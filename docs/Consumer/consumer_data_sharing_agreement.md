# Data Sharing Agreement
The data sharing agreement is an agreement between the AIP and AIU for personal data access. It determines the dataset/resource, list of purposes for data usage, how long the data can be accessed by the AIU and the terms and conditions for data access.
AIUs may request for a DSA to a particular AIP as shown below.
