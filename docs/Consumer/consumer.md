# Introduction

The "ADeX AIU APIs" allows an AIU to request and obtain tokens to access _Public_, _Private_ and _Personal_ resources. Access information related to a resource can be understood via the [AIU Panel](https://dataexplorer.ts.adex.org.in/aiu)

## Registration

A new AIU can register with an account when prompted to log in at the [Catalogue Panel](https://dataexplorer.ts.adex.org.in) or at the [AIU Panel](https://dataexplorer.ts.adex.org.in/aiu). Go to [Registration](../registration.md) for instructions on registering.

Once an AIU registers, they will be able to log into the Catalogue Panel and the AIU Panel.
