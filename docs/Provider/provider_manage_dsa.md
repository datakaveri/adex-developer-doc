# Manage Data Sharing Agreement

The data sharing agreement is an agreement between the AIP and AIU for personal data access. It determines the dataset/resource, list of purposes for data usage, how long the data can be accessed by the AIU and the terms and conditions for data access.

AIPs have the authority to approve or reject DSA requests created by AIUs. Additionally, they can view the status of DSAs, including those that are revoked, withdrawn, approved, or rejected.
