# Introduction

The ADeX AIP APIs allow an AIP to manage access to the secure resources they own via the [Publisher Panel](https://dataexplorer.ts.adex.org.in/aip).

## Registration and AIP Approval

The ADeX Admin team will initiate an AIP registration by first creating an entry for the AIP's organization. A new AIP can register with an account when prompted to log in at the [Publisher Panel](https://dataexplorer.ts.adex.org.in/aip). Go to the [Registration](../registration.md) page for instructions on registering.

**NOTE: AIP registration is subject to approval. A user registered with the AIP role may access the Publisher Panel once they have been approved.**
