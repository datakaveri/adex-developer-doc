# Introduction

The ADeX Delegate APIs allow assigned delegates to manage policies and delegations on behalf of the AIPs who have assigned them. Auth-Delegates can perform these operations using the [Publisher Panel](https://dataexplorer.ts.adex.org.in/aip).

## Registration

A new delegate can register with an account when prompted to log in at the [Publisher Panel](https://dataexplorer.ts.adex.org.in/aip). For instructions on registering, refer to [Registration](../registration.md).

Once a delegate registers, they will only be able to log into the Publisher Panel when the AIP has set a delegation and when the Auth server administrator has set a policy for them.
